# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Artem, an intern at Red Hat with a passion for functional programming, backend development, and cloud solutions. 

## ðŸ”­ Projects I am currently anticipating

- [Kuadrant](https://github.com/Kuadrant) - Kuadrant enables hybrid cloud application developers to securely expose & consume k8s services. Think AuthN/AuthZ, rate limiting, and OAS.

I'm learning Kubernetes, Go and always looking for new cutting-edge technologies to learn!
