# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Artem, a Computer Science student with a passion for functional programming, backend development, and cloud solutions.

## ðŸ”­ Projects I anticipated

- [Kuadrant](https://github.com/Kuadrant) - Kuadrant enables hybrid cloud application developers to securely expose & consume k8s services. Think AuthN/AuthZ, rate limiting, and OAS.

## ðŸŒ± Learning

I'm learning Rust and Haskell.

## ðŸ‘¯ Looking to collaborate?
